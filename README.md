## Spring Kafka Playground.
A package to explore the features available in spring kafka and spring cloud stream. The package was created as an
one stop shop for exploring kafka with spring and implementing various features like DLQ, Pausing and resuming consumer.
This is a living doc and will be updated as I explore more features in kafka spring.

This package starts from the basic implementation available in spring for kafka and **not spring itself**.
